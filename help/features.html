<p>Features Module has quickly become very popular due to the fact that it can take so many "exportables" from other popular modules, like views, cck, pathauto, imagecache etc.  Importantly for our use case, Features module can export from page_manager which means we get to export our context_admin variants for free.  There are no real tricks here, if you've ever done a panel export this will be very straight forward and simple.</p>
