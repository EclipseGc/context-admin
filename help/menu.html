<p>You selected your path on the intial configuration page, but the visible menu item options are going to define where your link shows up.  For example, you can place a link to this page in a pre-existing menu, a menu tab, or no-where at all.</p>

<h3>Menu Tabs</h3>
<p>By far the most useful solution to most of our administrative needs is menu tabs.  Menu tabs however come with their own set of confusion and misdirection.  To get menu tabs working properly you'll need to meet a couple of requirements.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A default menu tab (MENU_DEFAULT_LOCAL_TASK)</li>
  <li>An additional menu tab (MENU_LOCAL_TASK)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Default Menu Tabs</h3>
<p>Default menu tabs are really the secret sauce to making this work, but they are a little confusing.  Essentially you can think of a menu tab as being a set of secondary links on whatever menu item you're trying to view.  So if we're looking at example.com/link then for tabbing purposes it will need a default menu tab at example.com/link/view.  This will allow you to place additional menu items as needed, i.e. example.com/link/edit, example.com/link/add_node or whatever may fit your purposes.</p>

<h3>Other Menu Tabs</h3>
<p>As detailed above other menu tabs need only conform to the parent's path convention to properly show up on the page.</p>

<p><strong>*NOTE:</strong>If only the default menu tab is present, no tabs will appear.</p>
